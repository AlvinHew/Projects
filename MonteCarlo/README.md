# Monte Carlo Simulation of Flexible Water Model

This project computes the excess free energy with data obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of molecules.

### Methods used to calculate excess free energy:
1. Widom Particle Insertion Method
2. Free Energy Perturbation (FEP)
3. Thermodynamic Integration (TI)

### Systems investigated:
1. Low-Density LJ Fluid
2. High-Density LJ Fluid
3. Flexible Water Model
